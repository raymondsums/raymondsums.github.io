			<p>
			Raymond Su was born and raised in Malaysia. He has lived on three continents and speaks four languages. Ray is an avid longboarder, a tea-drinker, a mobile-MOBA enthusiast, dog person and a self-professed foodie.
			<br>
			<br>
			He is a dynamic UX designer and, at present, is pursuing his Masters of Information Science (Human-Computer Interaction specialization) at the University of Michigan School of Information in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He is currently co-leading SOCHI, the school's largest dedicated UX and HCI organization, with upwards of 150 active members, and was on the planning committee of World Information Architecture Day - Ann Arbor.
			<br>
			<br>
			Before graduate school, he was a project manager at MA3 and a designer at architecture &amp; interiors firms in New York City. He felt fortunate to have worked with well-known brands such as Swarovski, LVMH, Audemars Piguet and Glenmorangie, and on highly visible events such as Fashion Tech Forum and Art Basel after having spent a relatively short time in the industry.
			<br>
			<br>
			Aside from his professional work, he has collaborated with creative individuals, such as fashion designer Catherine Malandrino, Italian painter/sculptor Malvisi and fine artists Chan-Schatz Studio, which had honed and made an impact on his artistic sensibilities. 		
			<br>
			<br>
			On every project -<br>
			<b>He embraces ambiguous challenges with optimism;</b><br>
			<b>He practices radical listening and inclusion;</b><br>
			<b>He sketches boldly and brainstorms without reservation;</b><br>
			<b>And above all, he is in love with the process of making.</b><br>
			<br>
			Raymond Su is actively seeking a UX Design position starting May 2018.
