			<h3>01 Description</h3>
			<p>Urban homelessness is a big problem that have continue to coexist with many cities in the United States. Unfortunately, this problem appear to have worsen in recent years. Take a quick stroll in the public areas of major cities, such as New York City and San Francisco, and you will be quickly reminded of this 'forgotten' urban population.

			<br><br>

			While many contributing factors that are at play including, access to affordable housing, access to quality education, access to healthcare, employment opportunities etc - I thought that fostering empathy and creating awareness from within the grassroots to be a good starting point to address this issue. 

			<br><br>

			My key goal is to craft a compelling narrative and pair it with a seamlessly-designed virtual reality experience. I want to immerse users in a multi-sensory environment, by allowing them to step into someone else's shoes and have them pledge to contribute - either by volunteering or by donating - while they are in peak empathy mode.</p>

			<h3>02 Processes</h3>
			
			<img src="assets/vr-processes.png" alt="Processes">

			<ul>
				<li>Scouted and identified needs in my local surroundings</li>
				<li>Brainstormed and sketched eight possible solutions</li>
				<li>Created storyboards with 5 frames for all solutions</li>
				<li>Conducted multiple interviews with key stakeholders - homeless individuals and social workers</li>
				<li>Created multiple personas</li>
				<li>Used QOC (Questions, Options, Criteria)</li>
				<li>Produced low fidelity paper prototypes</li>
				<li>Produced video of paper prototypes being used</li>
				<li>Produced digital prototypes in Sketch and In-Vision</li>
				<li>Produced animated walkthrough in Principle</li>
			</ul><br>

			<h3>06 The Solution</h3>
			<h4>Compelling and Customized Experience</h4>
			<p>To get people engaged and onboard with the crowdfunding, I examined Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Patreon, and GoFundMe. On these platforms, a campaign's success is highly dependent on how compelling the description or video is. In my opinion, Virtual Reality excels at that. My design will provide a customized experience for each user so that they can connect at a much deeper level. The VR experience allows users to pick and choose storylines they are interested in. The users' selection will have an impact on the outcome of the story, and some of the choices they make have moral implications and is designed to maximize empathy. Secondly, the interface that I designed for this experience will be secondary to the virtual reality content. The experience will involve no controllers other than just the virtual reality headset itself. There will be a quick onboarding process at the beginning of the experience to help the new users learn about the controls. It is a relatively easy process that involves only three simple steps - opening and closing your palm (to summon the menu), and then point as one would naturally point to select. The interface throughout the entire experience will be minimal unless called up by clasping or unclasping your palm. Just as if you are using a touchscreen device, selecting something is akin to touching the content. It feels natural and is always within your arms reach because the interface is mapped to your arms maximum reach during the initial calibration, so everything is at your fingertips when users' arms are outstretched. </p>

			<h4>Quick and Simple Calibration Sequence</h4>
			<p>To calibrate extend arms outwards and you will be able to touch the content in a natural way.</p>

			<h4>Simple, Natural controls</h4>
			<p>Controlling the VR experience only involves three types of gestures.
			Clasping and unclasping your hands with the palm facing upwards to open or hide the menu, and pointing to select any interactive elements in Virtual Reality. Selecting an object in this VR experience is as simple as touching the content.</p>

			<h4>The Novelty Factor</h4>
			<p>Virtual reality equipment is not widely accessible yet due to its prohibitive price tag and the need for specialized rigs to run them. As such, the VR experience is designed for museums, galleries or public events â€“ where there is excellent potential create buzz and excitement among the public due to the novelty of VR technology and the social aspect of having these experiences take place in public. 
			</p>

			<h4>Donate in Virtual Reality</h4>
			<p>There are many opportunities to redesign the way we currently do fundraising. In Virtual Reality, we can ask the user to donate when their empathy levels are at the maximum or 'peak empathy.' To achieve peak empathy, the interface prompt for users to donate without removing their virtual reality headset. In addition, there will be a dashboard to provide them guidance on how much to donate by showing them the average donation size that others typically contribute. Indeed, there is no pressure to give, as that is not the sole design intent. My wish is that the content will do a compelling job of persuading the users and moving them to take action. Should users choose not to donate, they can opt-out with no consequences.</p>

			<h3>07 Reflections</h3>
			<p>I am well aware that urban homelessness is a highly ambitious and complex issue to solve for. While I am sure that what I have designed will not be able to solve urban homelessness outright, I trust it would be an important stepping stone to a better quality of life for the forgotten urban population. 

			What I have proposed combines the best of storytelling and the best of technology to do good by fostering empathy. I feel that it is poetic to use cutting edge technology such as Virtual Reality to allow us to live the realities of others around us to foster empathy. My hope is that this idea can be extended and applied to other fund-raising causes as well, to benefit and ultimately, change the way we crowd-fund, raise awareness and bring everyone closer together as a community. 

			Since the completion of this project in Dec 2016, I have observed many other similar implementations of using Virtual Reality as a medium to tell a story to benefit a good cause.</p>
